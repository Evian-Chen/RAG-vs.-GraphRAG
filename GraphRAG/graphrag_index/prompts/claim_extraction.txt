# =====================================================
# Claim Extraction Prompt (Optimized for Game Behavior Dataset)
# =====================================================

Your task is to extract ONLY factual, non-speculative claims directly supported
by the structured fields in the input text.

The dataset represents individual player transactions in a mobile game.
Each record contains:
- region
- spending_behavior
- payer_type
- intent
- price_bucket
- vip_group

===========================
RULES
===========================

You MUST extract claims that represent:
- behavioral patterns
- region-based spending tendencies
- VIP-level patterns
- intent categories
- payer type categories

Valid claims include:
- frequency claims (e.g., “mid_low spending is most common in Tainan City”)
- correlation claims (e.g., “stable payers frequently appear in Taipei City”)
- comparative claims (e.g., “high spending behavior is rare relative to mid behavior”)
- trend claims grounded in the data (e.g., “vip_0 players tend to perform low spending transactions”)

INVALID claims:
- narrative interpretations (“players enjoy…”)
- psychological speculation (“this shows motivation…”)
- adjectives not grounded in attributes
- claims about individual players
- claims involving transaction IDs
- claims involving price strings or narrative sentences
- ANYTHING outside defined entity types

===========================
OUTPUT FORMAT
===========================

For each claim, output:
("claim"{tuple_delimiter}<claim_text>{tuple_delimiter}<source>{tuple_delimiter}<confidence>)

Use ONLY the dataset patterns as source, not narrative sentences.

End with {completion_delimiter}.
