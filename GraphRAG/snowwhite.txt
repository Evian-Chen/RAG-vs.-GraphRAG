Chapter I — The Birth of Snow White

Once upon a time, in a far and silent kingdom wrapped in silver frost,
there lived a queen who longed for a child more than she longed for the dawn itself.
One winter’s day, as she sat by her ebony window stitching a cloak of white silk,
a drop of blood fell upon the cloth.
She looked at it and whispered,
“Would that I had a daughter with skin as white as this snow,
lips as red as this blood,
and hair as black as the wood of this window frame.”

And so, as fate is sometimes kinder than it seems,
her wish was granted.
A daughter was born, fair beyond measure,
and they named her Snow White.
But the queen, having brought beauty into the world,
departed from it soon after,
leaving her child to be raised by a king who loved her,
yet knew little of a mother’s heart.

Chapter II — The New Queen

Time passed, and the king took another wife.
She was a woman of unearthly beauty and cunning intellect,
possessing a magic mirror that could speak the truth.
Each morning, she stood before it and asked,

“Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
who is the fairest one of all?”

And the mirror would answer faithfully,

“You, my queen, are the fairest of them all.”

For years, this reply pleased her vanity,
and Snow White, still a child, played in peace among the gardens of the castle.
But as the girl grew,
so too did her beauty — gentle, bright, and unpretending —
until the day came when the mirror hesitated before it spoke.
Then it said,

“My queen, you are fair, it is true,
but Snow White is fairer than you.”

The queen’s heart,
a fragile glass of envy,
shattered into sharp and invisible pieces.

Chapter III — The Huntsman’s Mercy

The queen summoned a huntsman and said coldly,
“Take the girl to the forest.
Kill her, and bring me her heart as proof.”

The huntsman obeyed,
but as he led Snow White beneath the sighing trees,
he looked upon her innocence and faltered.
The child wept not for herself, but for the deer and birds that fled her step.
Her kindness disarmed him.

“Run, child,” he whispered.
“Run, and never return to the castle.
The queen’s wrath follows shadows.”

He slew a wild boar and took its heart instead,
bringing it to the queen, who, satisfied with deceit,
ate it thinking she had destroyed her rival.

Chapter IV — The Cottage in the Woods

Snow White wandered through the forest until the moon rose.
At last, she found a small cottage deep among the trees.
Inside, she saw a little table with seven tiny plates,
seven chairs, and seven mugs.
She ate a morsel of bread from each plate,
sipped from each cup,
and fell asleep across the seven small beds.

When the owners returned —
seven dwarfs who labored in the mines of the mountain —
they found her sleeping, and their astonishment turned to pity.

“She shall stay,” said the eldest, “if she will keep house and cook for us.”
And so, Snow White began her new life —
washing, baking, singing to birds, and sweeping the hearth.

Chapter V — The Queen’s Deceit

The mirror, being ever truthful, betrayed the secret.

“Snow White lives, beyond the hills,
with seven men in the forest still.”

The queen’s rage turned her cunning to craft.
Disguised as an old peddler, she went to the cottage
and laced Snow White’s bodice so tightly
that the girl fell breathless to the floor.

When the dwarfs returned, they found her pale and faint.
They loosened the laces, and she breathed again.
“Beware strangers,” they warned, “for envy walks in disguise.”

But envy is patient.
The queen came again with a poisoned comb,
and once more Snow White fell senseless.
The dwarfs saved her yet again,
but the third time, the queen brought a red, poisoned apple,
sweet on one side and deadly on the other.

Snow White bit it,
and the piece lodged in her throat,
and she fell into a deep stillness, neither living nor dead.

Chapter VI — The Glass Coffin

Believing her gone forever,
the dwarfs made a coffin of crystal,
so the world might still look upon her beauty.
They placed it on a green hill under the whispering pines,
and by day and night they watched over her.

Seasons passed.
One day, a prince riding through the forest saw her and was struck by sorrow and wonder.
He begged the dwarfs,
“Let me take her with me.
I will guard her as I guard my own heart.”

As his men lifted the coffin,
they stumbled, and the piece of apple was dislodged from Snow White’s throat.
She opened her eyes, gasped for breath,
and the forest seemed to sing again.

Chapter VII — The Awakening and the End

The prince and Snow White returned to the kingdom,
where bells rang for seven days.
The queen, still asking her mirror,
heard at last the words that undid her:

“You, my queen, are fair to see,
but the young queen is fairer than thee.”

In fury, she came to the wedding in disguise,
but truth unmasked her there.
Snow White forgave her,
but the queen’s heart, heavy with envy,
turned to stone — and she vanished,
a shadow swallowed by her own reflection.

And Snow White, with kindness and wisdom,
ruled long and justly beside her prince.
For beauty fades, but mercy endures.
And thus ends the tale of Snow White,
whose purity shone brighter than the envy that sought to darken it.
