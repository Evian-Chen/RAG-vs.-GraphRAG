# =====================================================
# Community Report Prompt (Optimized for Player Behavior Graph)
# =====================================================

You are generating a community report for clusters of entities extracted from
a game transaction knowledge graph.

Each community contains ONLY controlled entity categories:
- region
- spending_behavior
- payer_type
- intent
- price_bucket
- vip_group

===========================
WHAT YOU MUST WRITE
===========================

For each community, produce:
1. A clear, domain-specific summary of what this community represents.
2. Behavioral interpretation grounded ONLY in the structured attributes.
3. Zero speculation about emotions, psychology, or personal preference.
4. Only describe patterns that logically emerge from the cluster composition.

===========================
VALID REPORT CONTENT
===========================

You may describe:
- typical spending behaviors in that community
- common payer_types (light/mid/stable)
- dominant regions
- frequently associated intents
- typical VIP levels
- meaningful combinations (e.g., “mid_low + progress_boost + vip_0”)

DO NOT include:
- narrative sentences
- player motivations
- explanations not present in attributes
- market-size claims
- speculative causes

===========================
REPORT FORMAT
===========================

For each community:
- A title summarizing the dominant pattern
- A short bullet list summarizing behavior traits
- A 3–5 sentence paragraph describing the cluster meaning

Output your response in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "title": "community pattern title",
  "summary": "behavioral traits summary",
  "findings": ["finding 1", "finding 2", "finding 3"],
  "rating": 7.5,
  "rating_explanation": "explanation of importance rating"
}

===========================
GOAL
===========================

Produce precise, compact cluster explanations in JSON format
based ONLY on patterns within the structured game-behavior graph.

End with {completion_delimiter}.
