{"result": "The dataset reveals a dominant presence of players from the \"urban\" region, primarily exhibiting \"high\" spending behavior. The majority are classified as \"premium\" payer types, with a significant intent to engage in \"entertainment\" activities. Most players fall within the \"mid\" price bucket, and a notable portion belongs to the \"VIP\" group. The recurring combination of attributes indicates a trend of high-spending premium players in urban areas focused on entertainment within mid-range pricing. {completion_delimiter}", "input": "# =====================================================\n# Summarize Descriptions Prompt (Optimized for Player Behavior Dataset)\n# =====================================================\n\nSummarize multiple node descriptions into ONE concise, factual description.\nAll descriptions come from a controlled schema containing:\n- region\n- spending_behavior\n- payer_type\n- intent\n- price_bucket\n- vip_group\n\n===========================\nRULES\n===========================\n\nYour summary MUST:\n- combine the repeated behavioral patterns\n- highlight dominant attribute values\n- exclude narrative text\n- avoid any speculation\n- avoid describing psychological states or motivations\n- include only factual attribute-level patterns\n\nYou MUST NOT include:\n- adjectives not tied to data attributes\n- mentions of specific transactions\n- player-level stories\n- free-form narrative language\n- invented entities\n\n===========================\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n===========================\n\nProduce a single paragraph summarizing:\n- what attributes dominate the group\n- what behavior pattern is represented\n- any recurring combination of category labels\n\nKeep it factual and compact.\n\nEnd with {completion_delimiter}.\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 600, "n": 1}}
