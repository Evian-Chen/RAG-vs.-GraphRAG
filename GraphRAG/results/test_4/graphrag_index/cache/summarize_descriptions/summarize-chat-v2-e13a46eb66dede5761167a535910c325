{"result": "\"Low Spending Behavior\" characterizes a player's financial activity as involving small, frequent purchases, typically associated with daily tasks or basic item replenishment. This behavior is marked by transactions that are low in amount but potentially high in frequency, suggesting a pattern of consumption that is consistent and routine. Players exhibiting Low Spending Behavior tend to engage in small-scale purchases, often for routine items or basic supplies, indicating a spending level that is low yet frequent. This pattern is observed among players in various locations, including Taichung and Taipei, where the tendency to make small, frequent purchases is prevalent.
